## Group Process

Use Waffle.io for tracking issues:

* Add appropriate label when creating issue on Github (eg. "mvp", "stretch goal", "bug", etc.)
* If applicable, add milestone (day to finish) when creating issue.

Github/Git Flow:

* Branch names should include your name, the issue number (with #), and descriptive name, eg. 'pearl#13-readableDateFunc' or 'ruby#15-dateBugFix'.
* ACP **AT LEAST** once every 30 minutes.
* Never merge your own branch!
* Merge party whenever someone finishes an issue.
* Merge Party at the start (after standup meeting) and end of every day (5pm).
* After a merge for someone else's branch, don't forget to pull from master into *your* branch before continuing work.
